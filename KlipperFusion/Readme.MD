# KlipperFusion

KlipperFusion is a Python module designed to simplify the management and modification of Klipper configuration files. It provides tools for parsing, merging, and updating configuration settings with ease, making it an invaluable resource for advanced 3D printing setups using the Klipper firmware.

## Features

- **Configuration Parsing**: Efficiently parses Klipper configuration files, supporting a wide range of Klipper's syntax and structures.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Allows for dynamic adjustments and modifications of configuration settings directly from your scripts.
- **G-Code Block Management**: Handles G-code macro definitions and custom G-code blocks, enabling advanced customization of printer behavior.
- **Merge Configurations**: Seamlessly merge multiple configuration files or sections, making it easy to combine settings from different sources.

## Usage

To use KlipperFusion, you will need a Python environment set up. The module is designed to be imported into your Python scripts or applications where you can leverage its functionality to manipulate Klipper configuration files.

```python
from KlipperFusion.config_parser import ConfigParser

# Initialize the parser with the path to your configuration files
parser = ConfigParser(base_path='/path/to/your/configurations')

# Parse a specific configuration file
parser.parse_file('your_configuration.cfg')

# Make modifications, merge sections, or read values (refer to the API documentation)

# Write the updated configuration to a new file
parser.write_output('updated_configuration.cfg')
```
