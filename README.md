# FirstLayer: A 3D Printing Knowledge Repository

Welcome to FirstLayer, a community-driven repository dedicated to sharing knowledge and resources for 3D printing enthusiasts. Our primary goal is to establish a comprehensive hub for 3D printing information, currently focusing on printer configurations to optimize performance and print quality.

## What's Inside

- **Printer Configurations**: Find custom configurations for popular 3D printers within the [klippain_configs](./klippain_configs) directory. These are designed to help you achieve optimal printing results.

### Coming Soon

While the repository currently specializes in printer configurations, we aim to expand our offerings to include:
- **Scripts**: Handy scripts to automate various aspects of the 3D printing process.
- **Guides**: Detailed tutorials and guides on everything from getting started with your first print to advanced modification techniques. (Content under development)
- **Projects**: Small, collaborative projects that showcase innovative uses of 3D printing technology. (Content under development)

## Getting Started

To get started, explore the [klippain_configs](./klippain_configs) directory for printer configurations. As we develop additional content, such as guides and projects, announcements will be made, and new sections will be added to the repository.

## Contributing

FirstLayer thrives on community contributions. Currently, we are particularly interested in expanding our printer configurations. However, if you have ideas or preliminary content for scripts, guides, or projects, your contributions are also welcome. Please see our [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on how to contribute.
