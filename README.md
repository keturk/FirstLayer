# FirstLayer: A 3D Printing Knowledge Repository

Welcome to FirstLayer, a community-driven repository dedicated to sharing a wealth of knowledge and resources for 3D printing enthusiasts. Our goal is to create a comprehensive hub for 3D printing information, ranging from printer configurations and custom scripts to guides and mini-projects.

## What's Inside

- **Printer Configurations**: Custom configurations for popular 3D printers to optimize performance and print quality.
- **Scripts**: Handy scripts to automate various aspects of the 3D printing process.
- **Guides**: Detailed tutorials and guides on everything from getting started with your first print to advanced modification techniques.
- **Projects**: Small, collaborative projects that showcase innovative uses of 3D printing technology.

## Getting Started

To get started, we recommend exploring the [klippain_configs](./klippain_configs) directory if you're looking for printer configurations, or dive into our [Guides](./Guides) section for tutorials and how-tos.

## Contributing

FirstLayer thrives on community contributions. Whether you have a new printer configuration, a useful script, a detailed guide, or a project idea, your contributions are welcome. Please see our [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on how to contribute.
